Zendesk import automation! For Kipsu!

## Install requirements
First things first, create a virtual environment for this script.

Open a terminal and navigate to the folder you've pulled this repo into.

run the following command:
`python3 -m venv ./`

This creates a virtual environment, which basically just means we can control which version of Python and which dependencies we are using. It's fresh and so clean clean.

Now, you want to enter that virtual environment (as in, tell the computer to only play in this protected sandbox).

run the following command:
`source bin/activate`

Your prompt will change. You're in!

Lastly, install the actual dependencies by running the following command:
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
